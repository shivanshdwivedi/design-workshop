        It has the power to persuade and empower our decision making process. With the ability to influence our values and expectations,
         a good design can improve lives, create opportunities, and to bring people together. 
         The School of Design is thus an initiative that intends to sharpen your observation skills and bring awareness 
         to the beauty of design in your everyday life.</h3>

                        Jaideep “Swiss army knife” Chatterjee An obsessive compulsive multi-disciplinarian, Jaideep is an architect, 
                        a historian and an anthropologist. With a doctorate in History of Architecture and Urbanism and another one in
                        Socio-cultural Anthropology from Cornell University, Jaideep’s academic enquiries traverse questions of design, 
                        visual culture, techno-politics, social formation of expertise, popular culture and nationalism. 
                        His research on architects, and design as a form of knowledge in post-colonial India has been published with prestigious
                        academic presses worldwide. Jaideep has taught at several universities, including Cornell, The University of Cincinnati,
                        and the University School of Architecture and Planning, Delhi. In addition to his academic pursuits, 
                        Jaideep also actively collaborates with designers, architects, artists and filmmakers to work on many interdisciplinary projects. 
                        In his free time trains his pack of street dogs along with his German shepherd Norbu.
                        He is also a sci-fi nerd who loves to cook and deconstruct everything, from restaurant menus to milk cartons.</p>

              Abu Talha Farooqi did his B. Arch (2006-11) and M. Arch Healthcare Architecture (2013-15) from Jamia Millia Islamia. He is a registered architect with Council of Architecture (COA) – India since 2011. Besides, he is a BEE Certified Master Trainer of the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) of India.
              Since 2011, he has worked on architectural projects of different scale and typology. His involvement in those projects has been comprehensive and overarching, at times even covering the execution part; something which has helped him in holistically understanding the technical and pragmatic nuances of building projects. 
              He has headed the humanities track at SSAA focused on developing critical thinking skills, reading and academic writing skills. He has served as the head of third year design studio - conceiving the design brief, translating the brief into pedagogical studio lesson plans, etching out studio process, list of deliverables and assessment rubrics as well as maintaining coordination and parity across sections. As the head of the sustainability team of SSAA, he led the Academic Curriculum Integration Project (ACIP) in collaboration with the organisation - CBalance 
              fairconditioning.org; a pilot project aimed at integrating sustainable design into all the three principal tracks – humanities, technical sciences and studio.
              He has also designed and taught courses at masters level in Healthcare Architecture at Jamia Millia Islamia. As an ECBC Master Trainer, he has trained numerous government and state agency representatives across India towards understanding and implementing the ECBC in India.

              He has a deep interest for interdisciplinary researches and intersections of architecture with literature, poetry, society and cinema. He has conceptualized and taught elective courses on the intersections of architecture with poetry, cinema and cultural production. As an academician, he has strong beliefs in
              reinventing education models to equip the architecture student in responding to built environment issues and he constantly sensitizes his students about their potential and responsibility as designers towards addressing these issues and concerns.<br>

                Sourav Banerjea is a trained urban designer from CEPT University, Ahmedabad, who finds excitement in mapping subject driven politics of resistance 
                and urban space production through grassroots interventions within the framework of deep democracy and civil society revolutions. 
                Positioned within the arguments of Neoliberal ideology, Sourav constantly examines the status quo between all the vital sections of 
                the society. Ideals of inclusivity, informality, natural ecological systems and symbology informs his design approach heavily. 
                He has presented his ideas and research at a few international and national academic conferences, of the likes of ACSA and ACSP,
                where his research scholarship has been positively accepted and was dwelled upon. He has more than 5 years of teaching experience,
                being engaged at Sushant School of Art and Architecture, Gurgaon since 2014. His present research revolves around the infant city of 
                Gurgaon, flocked by millennials from all over the globe, where the primary enquiry is to understand the dynamics of speculative land and built 
                property development and its influence on citizen formation. <br>

                In order to keep himself constantly charged with fresh architectural thought, he participates in a lot of idea competitions 
                (often along with his students), where he further explores the design aspects of ideas like post-criticality, the diagrammatic, 
                social sustainability etc. to generate award winning concepts.<br>

                Sourav believes in the design led studio pedagogy of many western scholarly universities and urges such projects to become the 
                mainstream within the framework of Indian Architecture education as well. Design led policies will have to become a mandatory 
                field within all physical interventions in our country.<br>

                  Czaee, who frequently likes to adopt the nom de plume  dczaeen (puns are one of her many loves), studied architecture 
                  at the TVB School of Habitat Studies, before going onto getting a dual masters, with a M.Arch + Ms.Arch degree from the 
                  the School of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning at the University of Cincinnati, OH. 
                  She was awarded the best Research and the best Thesis Awards from both the programmes, respectively, for her theses
                  which investigated the gendered underpinnings of Modernist Architectural Representations, questions of narratives and 
                  translations and the creation of masculine subjectivities. She continues to explore these research interests,
                  through her own pursuits and her teaching engagements. As a practicing architect, she has had a wide field of experience, 
                  both nationally and internationally, working on a range of projects from Airports to Schools to Hotels and even designing
                  one-room residences. In her current form (pun unintended), she also serves as the Deputy Director for the Jindal Centre 
                  for Social Design.  <br>
                  She absolutely prefers the mountains over beaches, winter over summer, writing over calling, and dogs (not even a contest really) over cats. <br>

                        Broadly, she is interested in observing and commenting on urban habitation and its dwellers. 
                        She also practices Installation and Performance art. For her these two mediums reflect the transient character 
                        of the world that she lives in. Her passion is to experiment with tactile materials to form a composition. 
                        She enjoys working in big as well as miniature scales. She is one of the founding members of the

                        Besides art she loves to trek, watch movies and spend time with kids and listen to their stories.
